# PakTool
Tool for opening, extracting, and creating Quake PAK files. 

This was originally just a project that I started to learn C#.  I found the specification and went to work.
The GUI isn't feature-packed but it's functional.  Beyond the buttons...

- Double-clicking a file will instantly extract it to a temporary folder and execute it in Windows.  This temp folder is cleared on exit.
- This tool can put ANY files into a PAK.  This was a limitation with PAK Explorer.

The project is in C# and the project is built for .NET Client Profile 4.  In order to drop that down, which I don't really see a reason to at this point, there would be some work involved.

I'm open to continue working on this if the demand is there, but I just haven't had a reason to continue.  It does what I set out to do, simply and efficiently.

The library for this is 'Pack.cs' which can easily be grabbed and used, it's one file.
